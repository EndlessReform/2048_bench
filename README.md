# 2048 AI

The goal of this project was to produce a highly optimised engine for the game 2048. The game engine implements all the behaviour needed to play the game 2048, such as shifting and merging tiles, inserting random new tiles, and calculating the score. My MSc thesis was on using artificial intelligence methods to find strategies for the game of 2048. The aim was to find strategies which human players could understand and replicate whilst maximising performance. This required testing millions of possible strategies, making billions of moves. Therefore, having a fast game engine was an essential foundation. To stress test the engine an expectimax algorithm was used. This algorithm can perform very well on 2048, often reaching the 32,768 tile. To achieve a score so large, more than 18,000 moves and over 90 billion game states need to be considered. If the engine was not extremely well optimised this would take a very long time.

The engine compiles to wasm and therefore can be ran in the browser. See it in action and read more about the project [here](https://2048-ai.mattkennedy.io/).
