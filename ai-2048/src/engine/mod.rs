//! Engine module: compact 2048 board, fast shift/score ops, and
//! precomputed lookup tables. Public API stays small and ergonomic.
//!
//! - `Board` is the packed 4x4 state with useful methods.
//! - Free functions mirror the methods when convenient (e.g., `shift`).
//! - Internals (tables and hot ops) live in submodules to keep things tidy.

/// Initialize internal precomputed tables on first use.
/// Safe to call multiple times.
